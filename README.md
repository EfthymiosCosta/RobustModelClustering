## Description of files

* `robustclustsim.R`: R code for the full factorial design on artificial data sets with well-separated components generated from the Gaussian and the t distribution. The clustering methods implemented are Multivariate Contaminated Normal Mixture (MCNM) Model, the Multivariate Normal Mixture (MNM) Model and the Multivariate t Mixture (MtM) Model on the Gaussian mixtures, while for the t mixtures, the MNM Model has not been implemented (see project for more details).
